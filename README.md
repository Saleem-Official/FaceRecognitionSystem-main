# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect human faces from a live webcam feed and draws rectangles around detected faces.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Uses Haar Cascade frontal face classifier
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly project

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Webcam

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Install OpenCV if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
